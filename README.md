# William (Bill) Xia
Hello! I am a rising senior at Tufts University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. During the school year you can find me on the 3rd floor of the Joyce Cummings Center as a Teaching Assistant for CS 105: Programming Languages.

This summer, I'm back in Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman's Computational Health Lab at the National Institudes of Health. I look forward to continuing my work on biomedical text simplification. It's my hope that the final product can help improve medical and scientific literacy for the general public. I intend on publishing my findings by the end of the summer. 

## Interests
Within computer science, my interests include natural language processing (specifically, work involving large language models), reinforcement learning, game development, and programming languages. After college, I hope to either find work that allows me to develop NLP or RL technologies, or pursue a PhD.

Outside of my field of study, I enjoy playing Dungeons & Dragons, writing pieces of short fiction, going on hikes, and rock climbing.

## Ongoing Projects
- **NIH.** My research at the National Institutes of Health primarily revolves around [PLABA](https://bionlp.nlm.nih.gov/plaba2024/). I seek to develop language models capable to identifying complex terms in biomedical abstracts and producing consumer-friendly replacements for those terms. It's my hope that the final product can help improve medical and scientific literacy for the general public. 
- **Thesis.** This coming fall and spring, I intend on pursuing a senior thesis under the mentorship of Professor Vasanth Sarathy. My project involves using an LLM to direct reinforcement learning agents through dynamically-changing environments. I hope to show that LLMs can help RL agents more efficiently adapt to unexpected "novelties" in their environments. 

## Past Personal Projects
- [**NN-Flowers.**](https://github.com/onionLad/NN-flowers) A neural network capable of classifying flowers from the [Iris Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). This project was inspired by Tufts' CS 131 final project, which I heard about from some of my peers who took the course.
- [**SentAnal.**](https://github.com/onionLad/SentimentAnalyzer) A pair of sentiment analysis classifiers I made during my first week as an intern at the National Institutes of Health in 2023. One classifier uses logistic regression while the other uses Naive Bayes. Made using Python.
- [**BitCalc.**](https://github.com/onionLad/BitCalc) A programming calculator I made during Winter Break, 2022. It can perform standard arithmetic as well as bitwise operations like and, or, xor, and invert. Made using JavaScript and the React framework.
- [**Catacombs.**](https://team-catacombs.itch.io/catacombs) A 3D vido game I made for my final project in Game Design during Spring Semester, 2022. Made using Unity.
- [**Alchemist Dungeon.**](https://alko08.itch.io/alchemists-dungeon) A 2D video game I made for my midterm project in CS 23 (Game Design) during Spring Semester, 2022. Made using Unity.
