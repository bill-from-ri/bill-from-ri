# William (Bill) Xia
Hello! I am a sophomore at Tufts University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. My interests include machine learning, data science, game development, and operating systems. This summer, I worked in Professor Rob Jacob's Human-Computer Interaction Lab here at Tufts. There, I formatted data from experiment results using Python and MatLab, using MatLab's machine learning library to analyze experiment data.

## Ongoing Projects
- Inspired by the bitwise computations I had to implement for my most recent CS coure at Tufts, Machine Structures & Assembly Language Programming, I've begun work on a bitwise calculator app. I hope to have it finished by the end of Winter Break, 2022.
