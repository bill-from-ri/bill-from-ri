# William (Bill) Xia
Hello! I am a sophomore at Tufts University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. My interests include machine learning, data science, game development, and operating systems. I am currently pursuing an internship in Dr Dina Demner-Fushman's Computational Health Lab at the National Institutes of Health. My project involves building a tool that can identify and define non-consumer language in medical literature. It's my hope that the final product can help improve medical and scientific literacy for the general public. During this internship, I have learned a lot about natural language processing as well as how to conduct computational research. 


## Ongoing Projects
- I am currently busy with my summer internship. I hope to find a new programming project to pursue this winter. 

## Past Projects
- [**SentAnal.**] (https://github.com/onionLad/SentimentAnalyzer) A pair sentiment analysis classifiers I made during my first week as an intern at the National Institutes of Health. One classifier uses logistic regression while the other uses Naive Bayes. 
- [**BitCalc.**](https://github.com/onionLad/BitCalc) A programming calculator I made during Winter Break, 2022. It can perform standard arithmetic as well as bitwise operations like and, or, xor, and invert.
- [**Catacombs.**](https://team-catacombs.itch.io/catacombs) A 3D vido game I made for my final project in Game Design during Spring Semester, 2022. Made with Unity.
- [**Alchemist Dungeon.**](https://alko08.itch.io/alchemists-dungeon) A 2D video game I made for my midterm project in CS 23 (Game Design) during Spring Semester, 2022. Made with Unity.
