# William (Bill) Xia
Hello! I am an AI Product Management Intern at SolidWorks. Recently, I graduated from Tufts University with a BS in Computer Science and minors in English and Mathematics. 

I was previously a Summer Research Intern at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). There, I worked in Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman's Computational Health Lab on a project focused on biomedical text simplification, using Large Language Models to translate biomedical texts into content that can be easily read by lay consumers. It's my hope that the final product will help improve medical and scientific literacy for the general public. I was the first author on a paper documenting my research, which was accepted to ACL 2025 earlier this year.

## Interests
Within computer science, my interests include natural language processing (specifically, work involving large language models), reinforcement learning, game development, and programming languages.

Outside of my field of study, I enjoy playing rock climbing, writing fiction, and learning foreign languages.

## Recent Projects
- **Senior Honors Thesis.** I recently defended and submitted my Senior Honors Thesis, under the advisorship of Professor Vasanth Sarathy and Professor Matthias Scheutz. My project involved using natural language world models to ground LLMs to embodied puzzle environments.
- **Senior Capstone Project.** In addition to my Senior Thesis, I also worked on a Senior Capstone Project this year with two of my classmates. Our client was [ASLDeafined](https://www.asldeafined.com/), an American Sign Language education website. We integrated an AI-powered, Duolingo-like activity generation system into their website.

## Featured Personal Projects
- [**Pinterest Content Sharing Chatbot.**](https://github.com/bill-from-ri/KG_RAG) A RAG question-answering chatbot webapp made to help Pinterest users learn about how their content is shared. The knowledge graph was hosted on Neo4j, the backend was implemented using Python (LangChain and Flask), and the frontend was powered by React.js.
- [**NN-Flowers.**](https://github.com/bill-from-ri/NN-flowers) A neural network capable of classifying flowers from the [Iris Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). This project was inspired by Tufts' CS 131 final project, which I heard about from some of my peers who took the course. Made from scratch using Python.
- [**Statistical Token Classifier.**](https://github.com/bill-from-ri/CS136_Final) A Categorical-Dirichlet statistical language model to identify complex biomedical terms in academic texts, inspired by the work I did at the National Library of Medicine the summer before. Made using Python.
- [**SentAnal.**](https://github.com/bill-from-ri/SentimentAnalyzer) A pair of sentiment analysis classifiers I made during my first week as an intern at the National Institutes of Health in 2023. One classifier uses logistic regression while the other uses Naive Bayes. Made using Python.
- [**Catacombs.**](https://team-catacombs.itch.io/catacombs) A 3D vido game I made for my final project in CS 23 (Game Design) during Spring Semester, 2022. Made using Unity.
- [**Alchemist Dungeon.**](https://alko08.itch.io/alchemists-dungeon) A 2D video game I made for my midterm project in Game Design during Spring Semester, 2022. Made using Unity.
