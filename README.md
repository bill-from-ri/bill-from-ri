# William (Bill) Xia
Hello! I am a senior at Tufts University working towards a BS in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and English. Next year, I will be pursuing a fifth-year MS in Artificial Intelligence. During the school year you can find me on the 3rd floor of the Joyce Cummings Center as a Teaching Assistant for CS 105: Programming Languages.

Last summer, I returned to Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman's Computational Health Lab within the National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. My project was focused on text simplification, using Large Language Models to translate biomedical texts into content that can be easily read by lay consumers. It's my hope that the final product will help improve medical and scientific literacy for the general public. I submitted a paper documenting my research to ACL earlier this year, and I plan on writing one more paper based on the work I did this summer, which I intend on submitting for publication this summer.

## Interests
Within computer science, my interests include natural language processing (specifically, work involving large language models), reinforcement learning, game development, and programming languages. After college, I intend on pursuing a PhD in Computer Science.

Outside of my field of study, I enjoy playing Dungeons & Dragons, writing fiction, and rock climbing.

## Ongoing Projects
- **Senior Honors Thesis.** This school year, I have been pursuing a Senior Honors Thesis under the mentorship of Professor Vasanth Sarathy and Professor Matthias Scheutz. My project involves using an LLM to generate neuro-symbolic world models of puzzle game environments. I hope to show that LLMs can detect patterns in these environments to learn the rules of the puzzles on their own.
- **Senior Capstone Project.** In addition to my Senior Thesis, I am also working on a Senior Capstone Project with two of my classmates. Our client is [ASLDeafined](https://www.asldeafined.com/), an American Sign Language education website. We are working to integrate an AI-powered question selector into their existing lesson creation system.

## Featured Personal Projects
- [**NN-Flowers.**](https://github.com/onionLad/NN-flowers) A neural network capable of classifying flowers from the [Iris Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). This project was inspired by Tufts' CS 131 final project, which I heard about from some of my peers who took the course. Made from scratch using Python.
- [**Statistical Token Classifier.**](https://github.com/onionLad/CS136_Final) A Categorical-Dirichlet statistical language model to identify complex biomedical terms in academic texts, inspired by the work I did at the National Library of Medicine the summer before. Made using Python.
- [**SentAnal.**](https://github.com/onionLad/SentimentAnalyzer) A pair of sentiment analysis classifiers I made during my first week as an intern at the National Institutes of Health in 2023. One classifier uses logistic regression while the other uses Naive Bayes. Made using Python.
- [**BitCalc.**](https://github.com/onionLad/BitCalc) A programming calculator I made during Winter Break, 2022. It can perform standard arithmetic as well as bitwise operations like and, or, xor, and invert. Made using JavaScript and the React framework.
- [**Catacombs.**](https://team-catacombs.itch.io/catacombs) A 3D vido game I made for my final project in CS 23 (Game Design) during Spring Semester, 2022. Made using Unity.
- [**Alchemist Dungeon.**](https://alko08.itch.io/alchemists-dungeon) A 2D video game I made for my midterm project in Game Design during Spring Semester, 2022. Made using Unity.
