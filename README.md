# William (Bill) Xia
Hello! I am a junior at Tufts University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. My interests include machine learning, natural language processing, data science, game development, and programming languages. Last summer, I completed an internship in Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman's Computational Health Lab at the National Institutes of Health. My project involved building a language model capable of identifying and defining non-consumer terminology in medical literature. It's my hope that the final product can help improve medical and scientific literacy for the general public. During this internship, I learned a lot about natural language processing as well as how to conduct computational research. 

## Past Projects
- [**SentAnal.**](https://github.com/onionLad/SentimentAnalyzer) A pair of sentiment analysis classifiers I made during my first week as an intern at the National Institutes of Health. One classifier uses logistic regression while the other uses Naive Bayes. Made using Python.
- [**BitCalc.**](https://github.com/onionLad/BitCalc) A programming calculator I made during Winter Break, 2022. It can perform standard arithmetic as well as bitwise operations like and, or, xor, and invert. Made using JavaScript and the React framework.
- [**Catacombs.**](https://team-catacombs.itch.io/catacombs) A 3D vido game I made for my final project in Game Design during Spring Semester, 2022. Made using Unity.
- [**Alchemist Dungeon.**](https://alko08.itch.io/alchemists-dungeon) A 2D video game I made for my midterm project in CS 23 (Game Design) during Spring Semester, 2022. Made using Unity.
