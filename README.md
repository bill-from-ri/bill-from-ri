# William (Bill) Xia
Hello! I am a sophomore at Tufts University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. My interests include machine learning, data science, and game development. This summer, I worked in Professor Rob Jacob's Human-Computer Interaction Lab here at Tufts. There, I formatted data from experiment results using Python and MatLab, using the latter's machine learning library to analyze experiment data.
