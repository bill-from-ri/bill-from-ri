# William (Bill) Xia
Hello! I am a sophomore at Tufts University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. My interests include machine learning, data science, game development, and operating systems. This summer, I worked in Professor Rob Jacob's Human-Computer Interaction Lab here at Tufts. There, I used Python and MatLab to automate formatting of game data and brainwave data so it could be processed by machine learning models. Additionally, I performed exploratory data analysis to identify key variables from the lab's clinical trials to be assessed by machine learning models.


## Ongoing Projects
- During the summer of 2022, I began developing a 2D strategy game called To Arms. The prototype I completed over the summer was built with Unity. I put it on the shelf when the school year started, but have returned to it this winter.

## Past Projects
- [**BitCalc.**](https://github.com/onionLad/BitCalc) A programming calculator i made during Winter Break, 2022. It can perform standard arithmetic as well as bitwise operations like and, or, xor, and invert.
- [**Catacombs.**](https://team-catacombs.itch.io/catacombs) A 3D vido game I made for my final project in Game Design during Spring Semester, 2022. Made with Unity.
- [**Alchemist Dungeon.**](https://alko08.itch.io/alchemists-dungeon) A 2D video game I made for my midterm project in CS 23 (Game Design) during Spring Semester, 2022. Made with Unity.
