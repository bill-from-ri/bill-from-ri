# William (Bill) Xia
Hello! I am a sophomore at Tufts University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. My interests include machine learning, data science, game development, and operating systems. This summer, I worked in Professor Rob Jacob's Human-Computer Interaction Lab here at Tufts. There, I formatted data from experiment results using Python and MatLab, using MatLab's machine learning library to analyze experiment data.

## Ongoing Projects
- Inspired by the bitwise computations I had to implement in my most recent CS coure at Tufts, Machine Structures & Assembly Language Programming, I've begun building a bitwise calculator app. I hope to have it finished by the end of Winter Break, 2022.
- During the summer of 2022, I began developing a 2D strategy game called To Arms. The prototype I completed over the summer was built with Unity. I put it on the shelf when the school year started, but hope to return to it this winter. 

## Past Projects
- [**Alchemist Dungeon.**](https://alko08.itch.io/alchemists-dungeon) A 2D video game I made for my midterm project in CS 23 (Game Design) during Spring Semester, 2022. Made with Unity.
- [**Catacombs.**](https://team-catacombs.itch.io/catacombs) A 3D vido game I made for my final project in Game Design during Spring Semester, 2022. Made with Unity.
